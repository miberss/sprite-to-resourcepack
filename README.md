how to use:
- open python file, it will walk you through it
input files should look something like this.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a60b773d-4e70-4069-844a-24eecf685fc8)
output file should just be your resource pack directory or where ever you want the resource pack
here is where the skript file will be <resourcepackname>/resource_pack.sk
move it to your scripts folder, then you can do !spr("filename.png") and it will show (if you have the resource pack enabled)
