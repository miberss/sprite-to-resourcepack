how to use:
1. open python file, it will walk you through it
*(input files should look something like the image, and output file should just be your resource pack directory or wherever you want the resourcepack)*

2. skript file is in resourcepackname/resource_pack.sk
3. move the .sk into your scripts folder
4. if you have the loadSprite() you can do ```spr("filename.png")``` and it will show the file's sprite *(if you have the resource pack enabled)*
